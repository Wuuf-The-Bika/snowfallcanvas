# Blizzard Builder
Adds snowfall to any HTML element

To install with bower:

```bower install blizzard-builder```

To use in your page reference the canavs-snow.js file and create a new Blizzard object passing it the ID of the element you'd like to attach it to:

``` <script type='text/javascript' src='../canvas-snow.js'></script>
    <script>
      var falling = new Blizzard('parentID');
    </script>```

If HTML Canvas isn't available it will create a HTML element which will have the class fallback. You can use this class to attach a background image:

```.falling-snow.fallback {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background-image: url('../img/bg-snow.png');
    background-size: 100%;
  }```
